Administrators have the technical ability to perform the following actions:
* [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|Block]] and unblock user accounts and IP addresses from editing
* Apply, modify, and remove [[Wikipedia:Protection policy|page protection]] on a particular page to restrict or allow editing, moving, or creation
* [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|Delete]] pages with 5,000 or fewer revisions<ref>Pages with more than 5000 revisions can only be deleted by a [[WP:STEW|steward]].</ref>
* Grant and revoke certain user permissions [[Wikipedia:Requests for permissions|requested by user accounts]]<ref>Administrators are able to grant and revoke the account creator, autopatrolled, confirmed, edit filter helper, edit filter manager, event coordinator, extended confirmed, file mover, IP block exempt, mass message sender, new page reviewer, page mover, pending changes reviewer, rollback, template editor, and AutoWikiBrowser access user rights.</ref>
* [[Wikipedia:Viewing and restoring deleted pages|View and restore deleted pages]]
* [[WP:RevDel|Restrict and restore public visibility]] of information in individual logs and page revisions
* Edit fully protected pages
* Edit pages in the MediaWiki namespace, excluding JavaScript and CSS pages<ref>[[Wikipedia:Interface administrators|interface administrators]] can edit JavaScript and CSS pages in the MediaWiki namespace.</ref>
